    <h1>Computer Programming</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a
        specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis,
        generating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming)">profiling</a> algorithms accuracy and
        resource consumption, and the implementation of
        algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program
        is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is
        directly executed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">central processing
            unit</a>. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of
        instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a
        computer, often for solving a given problem.</p>
    <h2>Machine Languages</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">Machine code</a> was the language of early programs,
        written in the instruction set of the particular machine, often
        in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system">binary</a> notation.<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly languages</a> were soon
        developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text
        format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying
        addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine
        language, any two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.

    <h2> Definitions</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or
        algorithm. Some authors restrict the term "programming language" to those languages that can express all
        possible
        algorithms. Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language include:</p>

    <h3>Function and target</h3>
    <p>
        A computer programming language is a language used to write <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program">computer programs</a>, which involves a computer
        performing some kind of computation or algorithm and possibly control external devices such as printers, disk
        drives,
        robots, and so on. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a> programs are
        frequently created by another program to control a
        computer printer or display. More generally, a programming language may describe computation on some, possibly
        abstract, machine. It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming language includes a
        description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor for that language.</p>
    <h3> Abstractions</h3>

    <p>
        Programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure">data structures</a> or controlling
        the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow">flow of execution</a>. The practical necessity that a
        programming language support adequate abstractions is
        expressed by
        the abstraction principle.This principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the programmer to make
        proper use of such abstractions.
